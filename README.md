# Soble-Canny-edge-detection
This project demonstrates edge detection in images using Sobel and Canny filters with Python. Utilizing OpenCV for processing and Matplotlib for visualization, applies the two edge detection methods, and displays the results. It's a practical implementation for understanding how these algorithms detect edges in images.
